			<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<img src="images/founders.jpg">
			<p>Yoga Tree was founded in 2007 by Debbie Fung and Jason Lu, (partners in business and in life), with the intention to share the physical and mental wellness of yoga with the community. At the age of 23, these two visionary entrepreneurs took their savings, quit their corporate jobs and headed to the bank, requesting a small business loan to open their first studio in Thornhill. Their vision was to create a yoga community that openly embraced and acknowledged the different benefits from the array of yoga linages; hence the name Yoga Tree. Their mission was to connect students via offering various styles of yoga and to make classes accessible to practitioners of all levels.</p>
			<p>At that time, the bank only approved a fraction of the construction costs, so to make their dream possible; Debbie and Jason had to build the studio from the ground up, this included installing dry walls, installing the floors and building the custom furniture at the studio to save costs.</p>
			<p>Including Jason, Thornhill opened with only 5 instructors, Yoga Tree Thornhill stayed true to the goal of creating a place that allowed students to generate their own physical and mental healing. As Yoga Tree Thornhill began to flourish under the steadfast guidance of Debbie and Jason, combined with the integrity and commitment of both their staff and students, it was only a matter of time before it was clear they needed to expand.</p>
			<p>By 2008, a second studio was opened in Richmond Hill. They responded to student’s feedback and this space now offers a balance of heated and non-heated classes throughout the day.</p>
			<p>In 2011, their passion and dedication to Yoga Tree motivated them to expand to the downtown market. Debbie and Jason continued to refine their studios to better suit customers’ needs and in 2012, they opened their 4th studio at the heart of Yonge and Eglinton. Yoga Tree is now one of the largest chains of yoga studios in Toronto, with four locations across the GTA and a dedicated team of over 90 yoga instructors and yoga advisors.</p>
